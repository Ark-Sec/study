#### Primary key
A primary key is a field in a table which uniquely identifies each row/record in a a database table. 
Primary keys must contain unique values. A primary key column cannot have NULL values.

#### Foreign key
A foreign key is a key used to link two tables together. This is cometimes also called as a referencing key.
A foreign key is a column or a combination of columns whose values match a Primary Key in a different table.

#### Unique key
Unique key constraints also identifies an individual tuple uniquely in a relation or table. 
A table can have more than one unique key unlike primary key. 

#### Simple key
A simple key consists of a single field to uniquely identify a record. 
In addition the field in itself cannot be broken down into other fields, for example, 
studentId, which uniquely identifies a particular student, is a single field and therefore is a simple key.

#### Composite key
A composite key consists of more than one field to uniquely identify a record. 
This differs from a compound key in that one or more of the attributes, wich make up the key, 
are not simple keys in their own right.

#### Compound key
A compound key consists of more than one field to uniquely identify a record. 
A compound key is distinguished from a composite key because each field, which makes up the primary key, 
is also a simple key in its own right.

#### Super key
A super key is any combination of fields within a table that uniquely identifies each record within that table.

#### Candidate key
A candidate key is a subset of a super key. 
A candidate key is a single field or the least combination of fields that uniquely identifies each record in that table.

#### Alternate key
Alternate key or Secondary key is the key that has not been selected to be the primary key, 
but are candidate keys. However, it is considered a candidate key for the primary key.
