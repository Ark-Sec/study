## Basic administration commands
Reboot the system

```sh
reboot
```

Shut down the system

```sh
poweroff
```

Synchronize the changes of one directory to another

```sh
rsync
```

### User data

Creating a user

```sh

User IDs

- `0` is reserved for `root`

```

Modify user data using `usermod` and parameters

```sh
usermod -s /bin/dash <username>
```

Removing a user

```sh
deluser --remove-home <username>
```


### User passwords

Check account password status. `L` stands for locked. `P` shows enabled.

```sh
passwd -S <username>
```

Lock a user's account

```sh
passwd -l <username>
# Display
passwd: password expiry infoamtion changed.
```

Unlocking a user

```sh
passwd -u <username>
```


### User groups

Creating a group

```sh
addgroup <groupname>
```

Check if a group has been made

```

To find and move

```bash
find <path> -name '*<match>*' -exec mv {} <dest_path> \;
```


### Compression

Create an uncompressed tar archive

chmod ___ <target>

# Alphabetical, - for removing, + for adding
chmod u_, g_, o_
# u-users, g-groups, o-others

# r-read, w-write, x-execute
chmod _+r <target>
```

Creating a script

```sh
nano <path/filename>.sh
```

Example of a backup script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Copy original files to backup folder"
cp -aR /uploads / backup
cp -aR /etc /backup
echo "Create a tar archive of backed up files
tar -czvf uploads backup_backup.tar.gz /backup/uploads > /dev/null 2>&1
tar -czvf etc_backup.tar.gz /backup/etc > /dev/null 2>&1
```


### Special permissions

- **sticky bit**: used in `/tmp` so that all users can save files, but only owner can delete the file | `o+t` or `1`
- **setUID bit**: can oly be set on a file, and if the file can be executed as root, then all users can execute it as root | `u+s` or `4`
- **setGID bit**: can be set on files and folders and causes group permission inheritance | `g+s` or `2`

Changing group of a folder and subfolders

```Note: -R will change all the subfolders within the folder.```

```sh
chgrp <groupname> <path> -R
```

Finding files with permissions

```sh
find <path> -perms <permsint> 2>dev/null
# For setUID: 4755
# For sticky: 1777
```


### File and folder ownership

Change owner of a file / folder

```sh
chown <username> <path> [-R]

```sh
df -h
```


### Automating mounting

Adding UUIDs to `fstab` for mount on boot

```sh
blkid | grep <partition> >> /etc/fstab
nano /etc/fstab
# Then, comment out unnecessary info
```

`fstab` for swap

```sh
<filesystem>  <mountpoint> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
UUID=... none swap sw 0 0
```

`fstab` for regular partitions

```sh
UUID=... /mnt/<mountpoint> {ext4 | ntfs} defaults 0 2
```

`fstab` without the UUID

``` sh
nano /etc/fstab
/dev/sdb1 /mnt/drive ext4 defaults 0 0
```
